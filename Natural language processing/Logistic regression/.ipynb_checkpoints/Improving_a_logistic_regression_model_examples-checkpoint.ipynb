    "Most models have have settings or configuration values, known as hyperparameters, that can be changed to modify the fit of the model on the training data. The logistic regression model contains a hyperparameter _C_, which is used to control the penalty we apply to features that are less important (i.e.: more important features will have greater weight).\n",
    "\n",
    "The smaller the value of _C_, the greater the penalty to less important features. _C_ is a value greater than 0. You will recall from regression the regularisation methods Ridge and LASSO, which sought to minimise the L2- or L1-norm, respectively, by shrinking the coefficients of certain features. The penalty term had a coefficient of its own, which we called $\\alpha$, which controlled the severity of shrinkage that occurred. The _C_ value we will change here is precisely the _inverse_ value of $\\alpha$. In other words, the smaller the value of C, the greater the amount of shrinkage that occurs."
