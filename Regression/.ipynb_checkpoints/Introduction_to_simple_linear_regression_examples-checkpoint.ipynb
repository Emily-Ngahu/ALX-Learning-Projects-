    "## What is simple linear regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple linear regression is a statistical method that allows us to understand and predict the relationship between **two continuous** variables. One variable, denoted as `y`, is considered the dependent variable, and the other, denoted as `x`, is considered the independent variable. The goal of simple linear regression is to model the linear relationship between these two variables through a linear equation of the form: \n",
    "\n",
    "```y = mx + c```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this equation:\n",
    "- `y` is the dependent variable we aim to predict or understand.\n",
    "- `x` is the independent variable used for prediction.\n",
    "- `m` is the slope of the line, representing how much `y` changes for a one-unit change in `x`.\n",
    "- `c` is the y-intercept, indicating the value of `y` when `x` is `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why we use it\n",
    "Simple linear regression is widely used for several key reasons:\n",
    "- **Prediction:** It enables the prediction of the dependent variable's value based on the independent variable. For instance, predicting the yield of a crop based on the altitude it is grown at.\n",
    "- **Inference:** It provides insights into the relationship between the two variables, including the direction and strength of this relationship. It helps in understanding how significant the independent variable is in explaining variations in the dependent variable.\n",
    "- **Simplicity:** Its straightforwardness makes it an accessible tool for modeling linear relationships, offering a clear starting point for regression analysis before considering more complex models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## When we use it\n",
    "Simple linear regression is applicable under certain conditions:\n",
    "- **Linear relationship:** The method assumes a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables. Preliminary scatter plot analysis can help verify this assumption.\n",
    "- **Homoscedasticity:** The variability (or spread) of the dependent variable should be consistent across all values of the independent variable.\n",
    "- **Independence:** Each observation's residuals should be independent, ensuring no correlation between them for reliable statistical inference.\n",
    "- **Normality:** For purposes of statistical inference, the residuals of the model should ideally follow a normal distribution."
