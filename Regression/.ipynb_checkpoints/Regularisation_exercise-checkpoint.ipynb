The task involves selecting a target variable, splitting the data into training and test sets, implementing ridge regression with cross-validation to find the best regularisation parameter (`alpha`), and finally, evaluating the model's performance on the test set using the R-squared metric.

    "**Interpretation**: The R-squared value reported from the ridge regression model evaluation signifies the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. In simple terms, it reflects the goodness of fit of the model. A value closer to 1 indicates a model that perfectly predicts the target variable, whereas a value closer to 0 indicates a model that fails to accurately predict the target variable's variance. It should be noted that an R-squared value of 1 suggests possible overfitting and it should be treated with caution. Investigating the individual variables and their coefficients might add more insight to whether the model has been overfitted."

    "LASSO regression is beneficial for models that suffer from multicollinearity or when it's necessary to reduce the number of features in a model. LASSO does this by applying a penalty to the absolute size of the coefficients, effectively shrinking some of them to zero and thus excluding them from the model. This exercise involves reusing the scaled features and target variable, splitting the dataset, implementing LASSO regression with cross-validation to identify the optimal alpha, and evaluating the model. The output includes the R-squared value, which assesses the model's fit, and the count of features used, demonstrating LASSO's capability for feature selection."

    "**Interpretation**: The R-squared value here, similar to ridge regression, measures how well the observed outcomes are replicated by the model, based on the proportion of total variation of outcomes explained by the model. Moreover, the number of features used by the LASSO model highlights its ability to perform feature selection, reducing the complexity of the model and potentially enhancing its interpretability by retaining only the most informative predictors. The reduction in the number of features used in this LASSO model suggests that we should be reassessing whether the features included in the ridge regression model were really adding value. Try to run the ridge regression again with fewer feature variables, including only the relevant features from the LASSO model to see how the results change."
