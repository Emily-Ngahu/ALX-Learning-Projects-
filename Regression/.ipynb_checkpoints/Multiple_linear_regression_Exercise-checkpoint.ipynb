    "\n",
    "For this exerecise, we make use of the `enviro_indicators` dataset. The dataset comprises socio-economic and environmental data collected from various countries, focusing on factors related to sustainable development. It includes information such as forest coverage, biodiversity index, protected areas, rural population, and deforestation rates, aimed at understanding the relationship between human activities and land degradation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are the descriptions of the columns in our dataset: \n",
    "\n",
    "* `country`: Name of the country.\n",
    "* `forest_coverage`: Percentage of land covered by forests. This indicator represents the extent of forested areas within the total land area of each country.\n",
    "* `biodiversity_index`: Index representing the biodiversity level in each country. This indicator provides a measure of the variety and variability of organisms within each country's ecosystem.\n",
    "* `protected_areas`: Percentage of land designated as protected areas. This indicator reflects the proportion of land that is legally protected and managed for conservation purposes.\n",
    "* `deforestation_rate`: Annual rate of deforestation (%). This indicator quantifies the percentage of forested land that is lost each year due to deforestation activities.\n",
    "* `carbon_sequestration`: Amount of carbon sequestered by forests (metric tons per hectare). This indicator measures the capacity of forests to absorb and store carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, thus helping mitigate climate change.\n",
    "* `soil_erosion`: Rate of soil erosion (tons per hectare per year). This indicator indicates the amount of soil that is lost or displaced annually due to erosion, which can have detrimental effects on land productivity and ecosystem health.\n",
    "* `land_degradation`: Percentage of land classified as degraded. This indicator represents the proportion of land that has suffered a decline in its ecological condition, often resulting from unsustainable land use practices.\n",
    "* `rural_population`: Percentage of population living in rural areas. This indicator reflects the proportion of a country's population residing in rural areas rather than urban centers.\n",
    "* `population_density`: Population density (people per square kilometer). This indicator quantifies the average number of people living within a unit area of land, providing insights into the distribution of human populations across different countries.\n",
