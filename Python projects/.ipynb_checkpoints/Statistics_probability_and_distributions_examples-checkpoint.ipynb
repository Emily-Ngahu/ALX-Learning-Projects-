For example, getting dressed in the morning, we reach blindly into the drawer to pull out a pair of socks, knowing that there are white, black and blue socks in there.\n",

But we don't know the actual outcome until we pull our hand back out and examine the pair of socks it's clutching.\n",

Most common discrete random variables take on integer values, but that's not necessarily the case: if there are either 2 or 3 people coming to share a pizza with me, and we share equally, then the possible outcomes for me are one-quarter and one-third of a pizza."

Random variables have functions which map their outcomes onto their corresponding probabilities.

This sounds a little counter-intuitive, I know, but it has to do with the infinite divisibility of outcomes. \n",

For example, for the 400m world record, we could think of the probability of Wayde van Niekerk running another 43.03 second race, rounded to the nearest hundredth of a second, as the probability of time between 43.025 and 43.035 seconds."

To continue with our 400m example, we would evaluate the probability we're after by integrating between 43.025 and 43.035 seconds.
